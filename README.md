# Files manager

<p>This project is a summary of this back-end trimester: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.</p>

<p>The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:</p>
<ul>
    <li>User authentication via a token</li>
    <li>List all files</li>
    <li>Upload a new file</li>
    <li>Change permission of a file</li>
    <li>View a file</li>
    <li>Generate thumbnails for images</li>
</ul>
<p>
You will be guided step by step for building it, but you have some freedoms of implementation, split in more files etc… (utils folder will be your friend)<br>

Of course, this kind of service already exists in the real life - it’s a learning purpose to assemble each piece and build a full product.<br>

Enjoy!
